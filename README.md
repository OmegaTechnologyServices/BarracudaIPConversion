# BarracudaIPConversion
Utilize a Barracuda Firewall? Tired of having to enter block lists one at a time, or having to hand type into Bulk Edit? No more!

This script will take a formatted .csv file containing an IP address and the CIDR address and output a .txt file you can paste into the Barracuda Email bulk edit client. This is significantly faster than blocking IP addresses one at a time and this script will ensure the proper format is used to avoid mistakes when entering IP addresses

I've attached a few examples in the repository for clarity.
